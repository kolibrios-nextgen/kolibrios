# KolibriOS-NG

KolibriOS-NG is a fork of the [KolibriOS](https://kolibrios.org/) operating system.

KolibriOS is a hobby operating system for x86-compatible computers, its kernel is written entirely in [Fasm](https://flatassembler.net/) assembly language. Based on [MenuetOS](https://www.menuetos.net/), it uses its own standards and is not fully POSIX or UNIX compliant.
